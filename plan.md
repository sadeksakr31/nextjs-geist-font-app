# Detailed Implementation Plan for "TripMate" Flutter App

Below is the step-by-step plan, including all dependent files, changes, and error handling details.

---

## 1. Project Setup and Folder Structure

- **Create Flutter Project**  
  Run `flutter create tripmate` to generate the base project.  
- **Folder Organization**  
  Inside the `lib/` folder, create these directories:  
  • `/screens` – All UI pages  
  • `/models` – Data model classes for trips, activities, expenses, and travelers  
  • `/services` – Firebase, Google Maps, and AI trip planner service files  
  • `/widgets` – Reusable UI components (e.g., bottom navigation, trip cards)

---

## 2. pubspec.yaml

- **Dependencies**  
  In your `pubspec.yaml`, include the following packages:
  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    flutter:
      sdk: flutter
    firebase_core: ^latest
    firebase_auth: ^latest
    cloud_firestore: ^latest
    google_maps_flutter: ^latest
    provider: ^latest
    intl: ^latest
    font_awesome_flutter: ^latest
  ```
- **Notes**  
  Ensure you run `flutter pub get` after updating for dependency installation.

---

## 3. Main Entry Point (lib/main.dart)

- **Firebase Initialization**  
  Initialize Firebase asynchronously using `Firebase.initializeApp()` inside a FutureBuilder.  
- **Provider Setup**  
  Wrap MaterialApp with Providers (e.g., Auth, Trip data) to manage app state.  
- **MaterialApp & Bottom Navigation**  
  Define a custom Material theme (modern colors, typography) and use a Bottom Navigation Bar with four tabs: Discover, Planner, Trips, and Profile.  
- **Error Handling**  
  If Firebase fails to initialize, display an error screen with a retry option.

---

## 4. Screens Implementation (lib/screens)

- **discover_screen.dart**  
  - Display a full-screen Google Map (using `google_maps_flutter`).  
  - Use `GoogleMapsService` to load activity markers.  
  - Handle map load errors via fallback UI (e.g., SnackBar alerts).

- **planner_screen.dart**  
  - Show a "Plan Trip" button that calls the mocked AI planner from `AiTripPlannerService`.  
  - Display the generated itinerary in styled cards.  
  - Use proper async error handling (try-catch with user feedback).

- **trips_screen.dart**  
  - List trips retrieved from Firestore using `FirebaseService`.  
  - Use a custom `TripCard` widget for each trip.  
  - Handle Firestore connection errors gracefully.

- **profile_screen.dart**  
  - If authenticated, display user details and a Logout button.  
  - If not, provide a navigation option to `login_screen.dart`.

- **login_screen.dart**  
  - Provide two login options: Email/Password and Google Sign In using Firebase Authentication.  
  - Display error messages (e.g., invalid credentials) with SnackBars.

---

## 5. Models (lib/models)

- **trip.dart**  
  - Define fields: id, title, destination, itinerary list, dates, travelers, and expenses.  
  - Include `factory` constructors to map Firestore documents to objects.

- **activity.dart, expense.dart, traveler.dart**  
  - Each model contains appropriate fields and mapping functions.  
  - Add null and error checks during JSON (de)serialization.

---

## 6. Services (lib/services)

- **firebase_service.dart**  
  - Wrap Firebase Auth and Firestore CRUD methods (signInWithEmail, signInWithGoogle, signOut, trip creation, updating, deletion).  
  - Use try-catch blocks and return user-friendly error messages.

- **google_maps_service.dart**  
  - Provide functions to initialize the map, create markers for activities, and error-handling routines.  
  - If marker loading fails, return default/fallback markers.

- **ai_trip_planner_service.dart**  
  - Simulate an AI trip planner with a `Future` that returns mock itinerary data after a brief delay.  
  - Handle exceptions where the mock API might fail.

---

## 7. Widgets (lib/widgets)

- **bottom_nav_bar.dart**  
  - Custom bottom navigation bar that synchronizes with the Provider to switch between the four screens.  
  - Use plain text labels with clear active/inactive states.

- **trip_card.dart**  
  - A reusable card widget to display trip details (title, destination, date).  
  - Utilize proper material padding, margin, and modern typography.
  - If an image is used (e.g., a placeholder banner), use:
    ```dart
    Image.network(
      "https://placehold.co/400x300?text=Modern+trip+banner+with+clean+design",
      errorBuilder: (context, error, stackTrace) => Container(color: Colors.grey),
    )
    ```

---

## 8. UI/UX Considerations

- **Modern Look**  
  - Adhere to a minimal, clean design similar to Airbnb/Google Travel.  
  - Use consistent typography, spacing, and color schemes (without relying on external icon libraries).
- **Responsive Design**  
  - Ensure each screen adapts well to various screen sizes.
- **Error Feedback**  
  - Use SnackBar/AlertDialog for showing error messages promptly.

---

## 9. Documentation

- **README.md Update**  
  - Add instructions to include `google-services.json` for Android and `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS.  
  - Provide guidance on acquiring and inserting the Google Maps API key.
  - Include build and run instructions along with dependency setup notes.

---

## 10. Testing and Error Handling

- **Unit & Integration Testing**  
  - Test Firebase auth flows, Firestore CRUD operations, and Google Maps marker loading.  
  - Validate UI navigation between bottom tabs and error display behavior.
- **Error Handling Best Practices**  
  - Wrap all asynchronous service calls in try-catch blocks.  
  - Log errors appropriately and inform users through alert messages.

## Summary

• Created a Flutter project with a defined folder structure (/screens, /models, /widgets, /services).  
• Configured pubspec.yaml with firebase_core, firebase_auth, cloud_firestore, google_maps_flutter, provider, intl, and font_awesome_flutter.  
• Implemented Firebase initialization and Provider-based state management in main.dart with a modern Material theme.  
• Developed four main screens (Discover, Planner, Trips, Profile) and a Login screen integrating Firebase Auth and Google Sign-In.  
• Designed model classes and service wrappers for Firebase, Google Maps, and a mocked AI trip planner.  
• Created reusable widgets for bottom navigation and trip cards with clean UI and error handling.  
• Added comprehensive error management and README documentation for proper API key placement and initial setup.
